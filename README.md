This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is a project to demonstrate how to integrate an ESLint / Prettier workflow into VSCode:

- ESLint only for static code analysis
- Prettier only for code formatting
- Using an ESLint config like eslint-config-standard or eslint-config-airbnb
- Using special ESLint rules for React
- Linting / Beautifying works from VSCode on saving
